1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project solves the issue of learning more about the shoppers that go to this corner grocery store. 
They take the information of what the customers are buying chronologically and putting into a list to create a better shopping experience.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe I was able to understand how the C++ file creates the list to give back to the original file to end the program. 
Also being able to use both programming language is a big help as well.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think personally, I don't enjoy using the code to make text documents back to the user is the best. I like the .dat files that it can read from. 
I think being able to make things other than text files would be really interesting.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found the parts of impimenting the python code into the C++ was the hardest. 
I took my time and looked into my resources on zybooks and online where I could find how others use C++ with python in it.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think the biggest thing that I will take from this is using multiple languages in one or when they work together to make a full program.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I took the time to put in-line comments in where it tells you what each program does. 
I also gave the correct comments to put in at the top to show who made the code and what it is used for.
